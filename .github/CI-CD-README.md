- Pull requests to `main` or `develop`

**Jobs:**
1. **Code Quality** - Format, analyze, and test code
2. **Build Check** - Verify Android and Web builds work
3. **Dependency Check** - Check for outdated dependencies
4. **Size Check** - Ensure APK size is reasonable (<50MB)

### üì¶ Dependency Updates (`dependency-updates.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Scheduled: Every Monday at 9 AM UTC
- Manual trigger via GitHub UI

**Jobs:**
1. **Update Dependencies** - Automatically updates Flutter dependencies

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

You may need to set these secrets in your repository settings:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub
- Additional secrets for staging/production deployments (if needed)

### Customization

#### Changing Flutter Version
Update the `flutter-version` in all workflow files:
```yaml
- name: Setup Flutter
  uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
  with:
    flutter-version: '3.27.0'  # Change this version
```

#### Adding Deployment Targets
Edit the `ci-cd.yml` file to add your deployment commands in the staging/production jobs.

#### Modifying Build Targets
Add or remove platforms by editing the build jobs in `ci-cd.yml`.

## üìä Workflow Artifacts

Each successful build produces downloadable artifacts:

- **Android APK** - Ready for distribution or testing
- **Windows ZIP** - Desktop application package
- **Web Build** - Static files for web hosting

Artifacts are available for 30 days after the workflow run.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check Flutter version compatibility
   - Verify all dependencies are available
   - Check platform-specific requirements

2. **Test Failures**
   - Ensure all tests pass locally
   - Check for environment-specific issues
   - Verify test dependencies

3. **Deployment Issues**
   - Check GitHub Pages settings
   - Verify repository permissions
   - Check base-href configuration for web builds

### Getting Help

- Check the Actions tab for detailed logs
- Review failed job outputs
- Check Flutter and GitHub Actions documentation
